<p>If you think we can collaborate and/or communicate in a meaningful way don't hesitate to send a message!</p>
<p>Easiest way to get in touch with me is to send an e-mail to <em><strong>oea.works``at``gmail.com</strong></em></p>
<p>I'm not really keen on social media but I do have a few handles:</p>
<ul id="contacts">
  <li><a href="https://github.com/oearikan">@GitHub</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oearikan/">@linkedin</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also add me on Skype. The name is <em><strong>live:oea.works_1</strong></em>. Just add a brief message on why we should talk.</p>

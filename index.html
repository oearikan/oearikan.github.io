<p>Hi, I am Emre and I'm a biomedical engineer, tech enthusiast and a mediocre bass guitar player. In the past, I worked as a researcher at a university and later as an application specialist for various healthcare IT companies. Recently I took to building websites and grew a keen interest for all things software.</p>
<p>When I am not otherwise engaged, I like binging on <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOC</a>s, reading my kindle and playing scrabble with my wife.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to visit this page. It's a work in progress. Feel free to look around and drop a message using one of the methods listed in the <a href="{{ site.url }}/contact.html">Contact</a> section.</p>
